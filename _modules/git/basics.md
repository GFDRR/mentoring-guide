Git Basics
==========

As git is the most commonly used source code version control system, understanding the basics of how to use the tool on the command line is essential to working with other team members on a project. If you used a version control system before, you should find some of the concepts familiar. If you are new to using version control for your projects, you may find the entire concept overwhelming at first. Your mentor should be able to guide you through the process of working collaboratively using git or how to use some of the more advanced commands and techniques. Eventually, you should learn the most common branching and merging strategies and how these are used on active open source projects.
