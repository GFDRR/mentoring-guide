GitHub Basics
=============

GitHub is by far the most popular platform for modern Open Source projects and as such, having an account on this service and understanding how to use it essential to be able to collaborate with others on your future projects. If you do not already have a github account, go make one immediately and share your username with your mentor. If you have only ever cursorily looked at repositories on GitHub, spend time to learn about how they are set up and used. Ask your mentor for some key ones to look at that might be of interest to you and carefully inspect who is contributing to them, how branches and pull requests are used.
