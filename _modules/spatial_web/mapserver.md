MapServer
============

MapServer is a platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web. It is one of the oldest spatial web servers, is open source, cross platform and widely used. MapServer provides advanced cartographic output, support for popular scripting environments, support for all common raster and vector formats, and supports the most common OGC standards. It integrates with popular front end tools like OpenLayers and Google Maps. It does not provide an administration user interface such as that found in GeoServer, but is configured using map files or in a scripting language.
