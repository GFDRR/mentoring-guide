GeoServer
=========

GeoServer is a java basd spatial web server that follows open standards from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and allows organizations to publish their spatial data on the web from various vector and raster formats. It provides the ability for users to view and edit geospatial data and run analytic or other processes on that data. GeoServer provides the heavy lifting for many other Geospatial software platforms including GeoNode. It is very easy to deploy using web application servers like Apache Tomcat and has an administration interface that is easy to learn and provides the ability to manage stores of data and the resources contained in these stores.
