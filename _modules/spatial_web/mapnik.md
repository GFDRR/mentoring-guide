Mapnik
======

Mapnik is not strictly a spatial web server, but a geospatial visualization and processing engine. It strives to provide pixel perfect image output with very efficient and fast cartographic algorithms and has interfaces that allow you to work with Mapnik in a variety of popular programming languages. Mapnik is widely used to render OpenStreetMap data and forms the code of software packages like MapBox, CartoDB, MapQuest and others. There are many ways to provide web services on top of the Mapnik rendering engine, and some are linked in the Reference Material Section below. 

Goals/Objectives/Outcomes
-------------------------

* Understand the strengths of Mapnik vs other spatial web servers and rendering engines and how and why it is used
