QGIS Server
===========

QGIS Server provides OGC services using the same libraries as the QGIS Desktop application. This makes it possible to publish maps and print templates to the web from within QGIS Desktop and the resulting web maps look exactly as they do on the desktop. QGIS server usually runs as a CGI module inside Apache Web Server.
