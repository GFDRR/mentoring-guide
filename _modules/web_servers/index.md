Web Servers
===========

Web servers are the important software that powers the web. As a software developer, you will need to learn how to run your applications inside a web server in order to deploy them in production. Apache webserver is the most popular web server and can be used to serve several popular languages and frameworks. Newer servers like nginx focus on concurrency and performance and are widely used to deploy applications written in python frameworks like django or rails applications. This module covers the most common web servers and application servers for running python and java applications.
