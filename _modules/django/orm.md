Object Relational Mapping
=========================

Object Relational Mapping (ORM) allows software developers to work with the contents of a database in their programs using object oriented methods vs writing SQL. Django provides an ORM that allows you easily work with a database using application models. You should take the time to understand the principles behind ORM and then learn to use the ORM effectively in your own projects by creating models to match your use cases as well as using the ORM functionality to store and retrieve data in your application.
