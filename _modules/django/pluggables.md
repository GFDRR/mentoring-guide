Django Pluggables
=================

The Django framework provides an ecosystem of 'pluggable' applications that you can reuse in your own projects. There are literally hundreds of applications that can provide some or all of the functionality you may need for your application and can be plugged in to your project. Not all applications are as easily re-used as others, but before you dive into creating your own appliction, you should check to see if something already exists that may work for your purposes. You should consult with your mentor when you are at this stage of your project.
