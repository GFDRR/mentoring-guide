Django's Model Template View

Django follows the MVC pattern but uses a slightly different nomenclature. Understanding how Django Models, Templates and Views are used to create apps and projects is essential to being able to run Django applications in production or to create your own. You should take the time to understand the architecture and patterns and how to use them effectively.
