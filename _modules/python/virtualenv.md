Python virtual environments
===========================

Using virtual environments is absolutely essential to effectively develop software with python. It is used to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places and allows you to keep your global site-packages directory clean and manageable. If you are not already working with virtualenvironments, you should install and start using this tool immediately. If you are already using virtualenvironments, but do not yet fully appreciate why they are so essential, you should consult the resources below and learn about some of the more advanced features.
