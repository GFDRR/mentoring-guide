Debugging Python
================

Knowing how to use the python debugger (pdb) is required in order to do serious program development. pdb is easy to learn and you should become familiar with teh basic functions and capabilities.

Goals/Objectives/Outcomes
-------------------------

* Understand how to invoke pdb by setting a trace and following your programs execution
* Understand how to set break points using pdb
* Understand how to step through your code pdb
* Understand how subroutines and functions are invoked using pdb
* Understand how to investigate failures using pdb
* Understand how to examine stack variables using pdb

Reference Material
------------------

* https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/
* https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html
* https://pymotw.com/2/pdb/
* http://davedash.com/tutorial/pdb-the-python-debugger/

Measures of Success
-------------------

* Participant has demonstrated the ability to use pdb within their program to step through code, navigate functions and subroutines and examine the stack in order to debug their programs
* Participant has become familiar with the pdb documentation resources
