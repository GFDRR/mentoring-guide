Other Clouds (Rackspace, DigitalOcean, OpenShift, Heroku and others)
====================================================================

While Amazon Web Services dominates the landscape of IaaS and PaaS vendors, it is important to know the range of other clouds available and be familiar with the different services they provide and when and how they might be used effectively to deploy a project. This list is not comprehensive nor inclusive, it provides a basic overview of several key vendors and platforms.

Rackspace
---------

Rackspace offers IaaS, dedicated application hosting and enterprise services. They provide more hands on support than vendors like AWS and are widely used in the enterprise, by individual developers and by organizations with simple hosting needs.

Digital Ocean
-------------

Digital Ocean provides IaaS in a simple and easy to use way and is used by many web developers as a simpler and more cost effective alternative to AWS for many applications.

OpenShift
---------

OpenShift is a PaaS platform provided by RedHat that is based on an community driven, Open Source framework. It is possible to run OpenShift on a private cloud which appeals to many organizations who have their own infrastructure investments. It is used by developers to automate the provisioning, management and scaling of applications so they can focus on the development of the application itself. OpenShift provides a automated git based deploy workflow that allows developers to deploy their applications simply by pushing to a specific branch in a git repository and letting automation take over.

Heroku
------

Heroku is also a PaaS platform that provides automated provisioning, management and scaling of applications using a Git based workflow. It takes a very clear focus on developer productivity.
