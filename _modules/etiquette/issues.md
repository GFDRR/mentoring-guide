Issue Tracking
==============

When you encounter an issue with your deployment or use of open source software, you will need to file an issue in the appropriate place so that the project developers are able to look into the issue and potentially solve it or help you solve your local issue. If you have never filed an issue before, you should follow the material below to learn how to file actionable bug reports. If you are already familiar with the concept of issue tracking, a basic review of how to file good bug reports will be helpful. You should work with your Mentor to look at examples of good bug reports for relevant projects and also at bad or incomplete ones. You should understand the lifecycle of how bugs are fixed and software patched or upgraded. You should also immediately start using an issue tracker as a way to stay organized on your own projects.
