LMGTFY/RTFM/DUPE
================

It is very common for developers just becoming familiar with how open source projects work to ask questions that can very easily be answered with a google search or by reading the manual or by checking the list of existing tickets. You should always try to help answer your own questions by consulting existing resources before asking questions of others. If you feel like you have spent the time to carefully look for the answer, go ahead and ask, but you may be pointed at a resource you somehow overlooked.
