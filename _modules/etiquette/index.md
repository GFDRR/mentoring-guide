Open Source Etiquette
=====================

In order to get help with open source software you deploy and customize and when working on software projects collaboratively with others, you should understand the basic norms and rules of etiquette when participating on public forums where other developers participate. Being polite and straightforward, providing complete information about issues you encounter and understanding that most other developers are not being paid to answer your questions will help you get help from others on these forums and set you on your way toward being the one answering the questions for others that come behind you. Your mentor will help you introduce yourself in these communities and will help you refine your bug reports and may guide you in being more polite, complete or to the point as you increase your participation. You should also make a point to spend time reading others posts and looking for existing issues.
