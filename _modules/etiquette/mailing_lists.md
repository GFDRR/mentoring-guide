Mailing Lists
=============

Project Mailing lists are one of the most common ways that users and developers of open source software communicate. Most projects have lists for both users and developers and some lists are very active while others are not very active for extended periods but may still be the best place to get help or propose collaboration. If you are not already subscribed to the mailing lists for the open source projects you are interested in, you should subscribe to a few, read and search the archives and learn how to post to them.
