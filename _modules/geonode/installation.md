GeoNode Installation and Administration
=======================================

In order to use GeoNode for your own project, you will need to understand how to install, configure and maintain an installation in a virtual machine on your own network or on the Cloud. You should initially start with the GeoNode ubuntu packages in a Virtual Machine to familiarize yourself with the installation and configuration process. 

Your mentor will guide you through the process of determining a production deployment strategy based on your specific situation and use case. Follow the material below to begin your journey toward becoming a competent GeoNode system administrator. If you get stuck, reference the provided material to the greatest extent possible before asking questions of the community, but if you are truly stuck, you will find help in the community, and over time you will feel comfortable helping others. 

If you and your mentor have determined that a Cloud deployment strategy is the best for your situation, you should reference the Cloud section above for guidance on deploying using the specific platform chosen.
