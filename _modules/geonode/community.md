Joining the GeoNode Community
=============================

Like all active Open Source projects, GeoNode has a community of users and developers that help each other solve issues using, managing or developing on the platform who and work together collaboratively to do so. If you are going to be using GeoNode for your project, you should immediately join this community and begin to participate. Your mentor will help you introduce yourself to the community and let them know what you are working on so you can find others trying to solve similar problems or who may have guidance for you as you embark on your project. Reference the section on Open Source Etiquette above if you are unsure of the best way to join and participate in an open source community. Your mentor will guide you on your journey and you will soon be one of the community helping others help themselves.
