Using GeoNode
=============

GeoNode is an Open Geospatial Data Sharing Platform that is widely used by Government agencies and other organizations to publish their geospatial data in an interoperable and standards compliant way. Its primary purpose is to allow users to browse and search for geospatial data and web services as well as upload, manage, and share their own geospatial data. Users can create maps with layers and other data on the web and share these maps with their colleagues or collaborators. It includes a set of social capabilities that allow users to collaborate and interact with other users.


GeoNode is also a framework for developing applications that extend its basic capabilities for a particular use case or need. You should discuss the requirements of your project with your Mentor and determine if GeoNode is a good fit for your situation and use case. If it is, you will need to learn to become a power-user of this platform, how to install, configure and manage it and then learn how to develop with it to add the capabilities needed for your project. The following sections will get you familiar with the platform and guide you through the installation and configuration process. There is a lot to learn, and your comfort level with the platform and its constituent components will grow over time. You should consult with your Mentor early and often as you make your way up the GeoNode learning curve and seek their guidance on which areas to focus on per your project’s use case. You should also join the GeoNode community and begin to participate on the mailing lists and the issue tracker.

Basic Usage
-----------

GeoNode’s interface is quite easy to learn how to use very quickly, but you should make sure you understand the full range of functions and capabilities from the user perspective. You should be familiar enough with the interface to be able to teach others how to use it without using any reference material and to be able to help answer their questions about usage. The GeoNode User Manual is your primary reference and you should become very familiar with how it is organized and presented. You may want to go through it several times or spend significant time using the platform until you feel comfortable calling yourself a GeoNode power-user. Your mentor will be able to give you a list of other GeoNode’s to check out and use to help you get familiar with how others are using and customizing GeoNode.
