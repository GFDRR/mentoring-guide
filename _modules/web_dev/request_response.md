HTTP Request / Response
=======================

All web applications follow the same Request / Response cycle when serving content to browsers or mobile applications. It is important to understand the underlying principles of this cycle and exactly how web requests are handled by a web server. You should review the reference material below to understand the anatomy of requests and how servers prepare responses and be comfortable articulating how this cycle works.

Goals/Objectives/Outcomes

* Understand how web servers interpret requests and prepare and deliver responses back to the client
* Understand the anatomy of a URL
* Understand how query parameters and POST data works
* Understand how User Agents are specified and used
