Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
============================

All web applications use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to describe the look and formatting of documents written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is designed to separate the document content from presentation including elements like layout, colors, fonts etc. In order to make your web applications beautiful and functional, you will need to know how to author CSS to control the presentation of your application pages. Many web developers focus more on the backend of applications and never need to become experts in CSS, but having a basic understanding of how CSS works is critical to working on web applications.
