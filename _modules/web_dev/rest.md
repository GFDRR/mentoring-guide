REST
====

REST is an architectural style that is commonly used in web applications with the HTTP protocol. It relies on stateless client-server cacheable communications. RESTful applications use HTTP requests to work with (create, read, update, delete) data on a server using the HTTP methods. REST is not a standard, but it is now so common that you are very likely to encounter APIs that follow this style while developing your own applications and you may use a framework that enables you to provide a RESTful API to your own application. It is important to understand the principles behind REST, to understand why it is so commonly used and learn how to interact with external RESTful services in your own applications.

* Understand what CRUD means and how HTTP methods are used to do CRUD operations on data via a RESTful API
* Understand how to interact with external RESTful services using command line or browser based tools
