Virtualization
==============

Understanding how virtualization works and being able to work with virtualized environments is key to modern software development. Depending on your project requirements, you may be working with Virtual Machines on your local development machine using Vagrant and Docker, you may be working with Virtual Machines in the cloud with Amazon Web Services (AWS) or other cloud providers. You should endeavor to learn the basic principles that are common to all types of virtualization and work with your Mentor to determine which model and tools are appropriate for your project and situation and learn how to use those tools effectively.
