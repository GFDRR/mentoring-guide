Networking with VMs
===================

In order to work with virtual machines on your local develoment machine or in the cloud, you will need to understand the basics of how virtual networks work and how they are configured. If you are using VirtualBox and Vagrant, you will need to learn about Bridged Networking and/or Network Address Translation. On the cloud you will need to learn about elastic IP addresses and basic security group configuration. You do not need to become an expert in any of these topics, but you will need to learn how to do basic configuration in order to work in your virtualized environment.

Goals/Objectives/Outcomes
-------------------------

* Understand the basic principles of virtual networking and the different networking modes
* Understand how to configure Network Address Translation and how port mapping works
* Understand how to use elastic IP addresses with virtual machines on the cloud
* Understand how to configure security groups for cloud instances
