Sharing VMs and Images
======================

One of the key benefits of using Virtualization technology is that it allows developers and other project participants to share images of virtual machines with other team members. This enables complete development or production environments to be shared eliminating the need for each participant to install the tools and do configuration and shortens the development cycle. You should learn how to use images provided by others and how to make snapshots of your own virtual machines and share them with others. You should explore the repositories of images available in places like DockerHub, Amazon Web Services or via Vagrant and become familiar way that VM images are shared with the wider world.
