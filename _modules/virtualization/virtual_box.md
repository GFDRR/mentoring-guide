Virtual Box
===========

Virtual Box is a general purpose, cross-platform virtualization tool for x86 hardware. It provides the ability to virtualize desktop/laptop class machines to create Virtual Machines for use in development and can be deployed in datacenters. Since it is free and open source and can run on windows, linux or mac, it is the easiest way to use virtualization technology on your own machine as part of your development environment. Vagrant is used on top of VirtualBox to automate the provisioning and management of virtual machines (boxes) and is covered in another section. You should become familiar with how to work with VirtualBox on your own development machine and begin to learn about the general principles of virtualization which are applicable across more complex virtualization environments including the cloud.
