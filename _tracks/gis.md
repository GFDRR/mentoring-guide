GIS Analyst / QGIS Plugin Developers Track
==========================================

This track covers the use of the QGIS application as well as how this application provides a framework for extension and custom GIS application development. It also covers the use of the InaSAFE plugin and framework which is used for Disaster Risk analysis and resilience planning. If you are new to desktop GIS, it is a good idea to spend some time learning about the basic principles of GIS and how they are applied and used in QGIS. If you are coming to QGIS with a background in other desktop GIS tools, you should spend the time to learn how to perform common GIS tasks using QGIS. If you are a software developer being exposed to QGIS for the first time, you should dig into the APIs and interfaces available to you to make full use of the power of the QGIS and underlying libraries for analysis or data management.
