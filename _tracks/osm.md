OpenStreetMap Track
===================

OpenStreetMap is a global repository of geospatial data collected, maintained and managed by people all over the world, a map rendered from this data as well as an ecosystem of tools used to work with this data and the community behind these tools. This track covers how to contribute to the OpenStreetMap database by using various tools to edit the map, how to work with the OpenStreetMap data as a database, how to develop tools and applications based on OpenStreetMap data and how to teach others to join the community and contribute. If you are not at all familiar with OSM, you should start by becoming a competent editor and contributor and then move on to more advanced topics. If you are already an OSM contributor and want to start the process of becoming an OSM power user, follow the modules below to advance your learning and skills. Consult with your mentor about additional resources that may be applicable for your use case or application.
