Mobile Development Track
========================

This module explores mobile development using the android platform and covers several applications that are commonly used in International Development, Disaster Risk Management and Community Mapping. If you are new to android development, you should spend the time to become familiar with the platform itself and work toward getting your development environment setup and ready for you to be productive. If you are already an competent android developer and ready to learn about these specific tools, you should dive right into ODK and OMK and begin the process of figuring out how to develop for these platforms to extend their functionality, add new features or fix issues applicable to your project or application.
